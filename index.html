        <p id="para2"><b>Budget:</b> The first step is to determine how much house you can afford. You'll need to consider your income, savings, debt, credit score, and monthly expenses. You'll also need to factor in the costs of buying a house, such as down payment, closing costs, inspection fees, taxes, insurance, and maintenance. A general rule of thumb is to spend no more than 28% of your gross income on housing expenses, and no more than 36% on total debt payments.</p>

        <p id="para3"><b>Location:</b> The second step is to choose a location that suits your needs and preferences. You'll need to consider the neighborhood, the school district, the commute time, the amenities, the safety, and the future growth potential. You'll also need to compare the home values and market trends in different areas, and see how they fit your budget and goals. A good way to find out more about a location is to visit it at different times of the day and week, and talk to the residents and local agents.</p>
